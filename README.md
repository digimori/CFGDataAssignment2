You should:
+ Use boolean values and if..else statements to branch logic of your program
+ Use a data structure like a list, dictionary, set or tuple to store values
+ Use a for loop or a while loop to reduce repetition
+ Use functions with returns to make code reusable
+ Use string slicing
+ Use at least two inbuilt functions
+ Use any free API to get some information as json.
+ Add comments to explain how your instructor can set up any necessary API keys and
briefly how you are using the API
+ Import an additional module and use it. If it needs to be installed, explain how to do that
